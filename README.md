# CSS-Only GitHub Buttons (Unofficial)

While trying to create an AMP webpage, I ran into the problem of not being able to use the JavaScript dependant GitHub buttons implementations currently available. So I created a CSS-only variant using GitHub's octicons and layered backgrounds in CSS3. 

## Usage

 1. Just copy the text in [here](https://github.com/trenton-telge/gh-buttons/blob/master/gh-buttons.css) to your `<style amp-custom>` tag.
 2. And add a `class="gh-button"` to any a or button you want.
 3. Don't forget to add text!

It should look like `<a class="gh-button">View on GitHub</a>`.

## Example
